Songbird is an application designed for small music artists to build a following. The app allows users to provide a link to their Spotify accounts, which allows the application to retrieve and display their information. Artists are able to be discovered by new listeners and added to their likes page. A user's likes page allows them to see artists they were previously fond of and view them on other provided platforms.
